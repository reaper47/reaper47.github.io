  <h2 id="first" class="center">Programming Languages</h2>
  <h6 class="center date">16 December 2015</h6>

  <p>
    Programming is beautiful. Indeed, we humans are able to solve a bunch 
    of problems to make our lives simpler and easier. It even saves lives as
    the world of medecine depends, to a certain extent, on the use of technology
    to treat patients, and to detect
    possible diseases and malfunctions. What are those technological 
    tools based on? Code. What is code? Generally combinations of ASCII
    alphabetical letters. What are ASCII letters? Letters represented by 
    bits. What are bits?Zeroes and ones working flawlessly
    together, perfectly in synchronization, to get special stuff done. 
    Hence, programming gets a job done. And it's a canon skillset.
  </p>
  <p class="center">Programming languages are divided into three categories:</p>
  <ul class="center">
    <li>Low-level</li>
    <li>High-level</li>
    <li>Very high-level
  </ul>
  <p>
    The latter being said, let's get down to business. 
    Since the beginning of the digital age, numerous programming 
    languages have been developed as to solve problems. 
    This beginning of a new era saw it's roots back in 1949 with the creation of assembly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Low-level programming languages, as defined by Wikipedia,
    provide little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction
    set architecture—commands or functions in the language map closely
    to processor instructions. Generally this refers to either machine
    code or assembly language. The word "low" refers to the small
    or nonexistent amount of abstraction between the language and
    machine language; because of this, low-level languages are sometimes 
    described as being "close to the hardware." Because of
    the close relationship between the language and the hardware architecture 
    programs written in low-level languages tend to be relatively non-portable.
    If you want to learn on the subject, head over
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language"> here</a>.
    In other words, low-level programming languages such as Assembly provide 
    the fastest programs at a cost of being harder and longer to write.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following figure shows a sample of how the assembly
    language looks like. It's actually a Motorola MC6800 Assembly
    listing which shows original assembly language and the assembled
    form. Does it look like the JavaScript we've been learning through Khan
    Academy? I bet you not!

  <p>
    Not really love at first sight, eh? Below is another 
    program written in Assembly that outputs not a Motorola 
    protocol, but a simple "Hello, World" program. Enjoy!

    This program is the fastest way for a computer to 
    output "Hello, world!" Now, let's stop fiddling around,
    and move on to high-level programming language!
  </p>
  <p>
    A high-level programming language is one that offers 
    a certain level of abstraction.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language">Wikipedia</a> 
    defines such concept as a programming language with strong 
    abstraction from the details of the computer. In comparison to
    low-level programming languages, it may
    use natural language elements, be easier to use, or may automate 
    (or even hide entirely) significant areas of computing systems 
    (e.g. memory management), making the process of developing a program 
    simpler and more understandable relative to a lower-level
    language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how "high-level"
    a programming language is. "High-level language" refers to the higher 
    level of abstraction from machine language. Rather than dealing with 
    registers, memory addresses and call stacks,
    high-level languages deal with variables, arrays, objects, complex arithmetic
    or boolean expressions, subroutines and functions, loops, threads, locks, 
    and other abstract computer science concepts, with a focus on usability over
    optimal program efficiency.
    Unlike low-level assembly languages, high-level languages have few, if any,
    language elements that translate directly into a machine's native opcodes. 
    Other features, such as string handling routines, object-oriented language 
    features, and file input/output,
    may also be present.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence, a high-level programming language requires a compiler or an
    interpreter that is responsable in translating the written code to 
    machine code, being zeroes and ones. Examples include C, C++, C#, 
    Python, Ruby, Java, JavaScript, Lisp, Fortran, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, very high-level programming languages is a programming 
    language with a very high level of abstraction.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_high-level_programming_language">
     Wikipedia</a> adds that Very high-level programming languages are 
     usually domain-specific languages, limited to a very specific 
     application, purpose, or type of task, and often scripting 
     languages (especially extension languages), controlling
    a specific environment. For this reason, very high-level programming 
    languages are often referred to as goal-oriented programming languages.
    It also adds that the term VHLL [very high-level programming language] 
    was used in the 1990s for what are
    today more often called high-level languages (not "very") used 
    for scripting, such as Perl, Python, Ruby, and Visual Basic.

  <h2 id="second" class="center">Beautiful Songs</h2>
  <h6 class="center date">16 December 2015 \\ Updated: 02 February 2016</h6>
  <h4>There is no doubt music is part of us</h4>
  <p>
    Music has the power kick start the steam engine for hours before 
    falling back to offline mode; it gives us the energy to motivate 
    us in completing tasks. There is a saying that states magic does 
    not exist, but this cannot hold true when <em>good</em> music plays!
    Yes, music is a rather touchy, and subjective subject, but every
    human being on this Earth likes a particular genre of music. A genre 
    that fuels their blood and soul.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, enough of this chatter, and let's get down to business! 
    The goal of this blog post is to showcase a not one, but <em>six</em> 
    songs I personally really like. Perhaps you will like them, perhaps not. 
    Anyway, here it comes!
  </p>
  <h4>Six Great Songs</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndAOIKzI_A8">
            Children of Bodom: A Symphony Tribute</a>
    </li>
    <p class="caption">
      This first one is a, as the title implies, a symphonic tribute 
      to the finnish melodic death metal band: <strong>Children of Bodom</strong>. 
      Formed in 1993, these finnish metallers are 
      widely known worldwide for their state-of-art creative music, 
      musicianship, and jaw-dropping guitar and keyboard solos. 
      This tribute proves how <em>great</em> their work translates
      to classical music. Go on, give it a spin!
    </p>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs5727QFhtw">
              Wintersun - Battle Against Time
           </a>
    </li>
    <p class="caption">
      Wintersun is truly a <em>magnificent</em> 
      finnish band. It all started out in 2003 with 
      Jari Mäenpää after being fired from Ensiferum. 
      Originally, Wintersun was a one-man band; the debut
      album was crafted by this master mind while later albums featured
      a band of four. Wintersun is considered as epic metal, 
      combining mind-crushing melodies, proficient guitar playing, 
      beautiful keyboard melodies, and fast drums. Give them a listen, you will not regret it!

    </p>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1lXdLus2WI">
               Eluveitie - A Rose for Epona
           </a>
    </li>
    <p class="caption">The Swiss folk metal band <strong>Eluveitie</strong> 
    was formed in 2002. Their music features the use of traditional instruments 
    along with a mix of harsh & clean vocals as well as guitars. One instrument 
    they use many have never heard of is the hurdy-gurdy.
    </p>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZMWKCgvaDY">
               Insomnium - One For Sorrow
           </a>
    </li>
    <p class="caption">Insomnium is a legendary melodic 
    death metal band from Finland that play dark songs filled 
    with sorrow. The guitars are tuned at a couple steps below 
    standard tuning to achieve this darkness. Also, one can relate 
    directly to their lyrics. Enjoy the darkness!
    </p>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aYiiGd3PZc">
               E.S. Posthumus - Unstoppable
           </a>
    </li>
    <p class="caption">
        Prepare for the ultimate 
        productivity-enhancement power song! 
        Anonymous sure love it.
    </p>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwJqUbd1vzs">
               Syd Matters - To All Of You
           </a>
    </li>
    <p class="caption">
        I discovered this song while
        playing <em>Life Is Strange</em>.
        I fell in love with it, and
        I'm convinced you will too! It is
        a perfect song to boost your motivation.
        Also, the lyrics are beautiful.
